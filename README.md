This code will first load the data from the stories.csv file. Then, it will split the data into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the classifier, and the test set will be used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

The classifier is a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. It is trained on the training set, and it is evaluated on the test set. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using precision, recall, f1, and accuracy scores.

The code then prints the precision, recall, f1, and accuracy scores for the classifier. These scores can be used to see how well the classifier is performing.
